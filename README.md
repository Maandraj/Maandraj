### Hello ladies and gentlemen ðŸ‘‹
I won't talk much, as obviously I am a developer (3.5 years), at the moment it is an android developer (already 1.5 years including commercial experience). I try to actively supplement my github with projects in which there is a part of me. If you have any advice or complaints about my code, then you can write to me about it, we will discuss it together under coffee :)
